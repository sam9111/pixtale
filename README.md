# Pixtale

With Pixtale, users can get videos of their trips narrated by Gemini AI. The process involves uploading a zip file containing photos and videos from the trip or selecting a Google Photos album. Pixtale then extracts metadata, generates descriptions using Gemini AI, creates a narrative script, converts the narration to audio, and combines everything into a final video. Additionally, Pixtale generates captions, hashtags, and a mini blog post to share on social media.

 If denied access, no Google Photos album will be available in the dropdown at localhost:5000
 
 If an account is given access, a token.json file should appear in the _secrets_ folder.

## Notes

sample.zip contains a few photos and videos to test Pixtale with.

Since this can only be tested in a local environment, processing can be slow for audio and video generation. Hence, please consider trying out features and waiting completely for it to finish before trying out something else.
